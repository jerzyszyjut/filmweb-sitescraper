# filmweb-sitescraper
Filmweb is a polish version of imdb (Internet Movie DataBase), I used it to scrape data for my project for databases course during my studies. We were told to do our insert commands manually which I found very odd so I automated it with Python❤️. My script scrapes data from filmweb using `requests` and `bs4` (Beautiful Soup), creates fake people using `faker` library, and then parses them into SQL files. To run the script you must install libraries mentioned earlier and just run `sitescraper.py`. You can manipulate amount of scraped movies in script by changing `strony_filmow` (pages of movies) variable, You can manipulate amount of fake users using `uzytkownicy_platformy` variable. Script is written in polish because it was written quickly just to be run once.
